Derek started his production career in 1985 as part of the creative team for Danny’s Big Night a film exploring young men and women’s attitudes towards contraception in the mid-1980s. Written by Trix Worrell and produced as part of the Family Planning Association (FPA)’s “Men Too” campaign, it sought to shift perceptions of male responsibility in the era of the AIDS epidemic. 

Derek then became part of the ‘L8R’ production team at its inception and won a BAFTA in 2012 as well as being nominated for a BAFTA in 2013. The ‘L8R series 1 & 2’ and ‘L8R Youngers’ ran for eight years and was voted one of the three most creative children’s programmes by Broadcast Magazine; won the Royal Television Society Education Award; the Basel-Karlsruhe Multimedia Award and three BAFTA’s plus three further BAFTA nominations.
