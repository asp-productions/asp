Triple BAFTA Award winners, Actorshop, have merged with Pampaset to form ASP productions with a vision of producing popular work that reflects and celebrates the diversity of modern Britain, for television and film.

We are currently seeking writers who are interested in working closely with us to develop ideas for our slate. We are looking for powerfully authored stories that authentically reflect who we are and examine how we live today in Britain.

To date weâ€™ve had development commissions from studios such as Channel 4, CBBC, and BBC 3. Our relationship with commissioning editors and major broadcasters affords us the opportunity to get great ideas read and considered for production.
