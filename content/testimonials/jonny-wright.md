> I've had a great relationship with first Pampaset and now Actorshop. Through them I got my first film and then television development deals and without their support, I don't know if I'd still be writing today.  Not only do I completely buy into their ethos in regards to diversity but over the years they have given me great notes on my work.  I hope to work with them for many years to come.
