"Before meeting Derek and Don I had only vague ambitions of becoming a screenwriter. Like anyone interested in writing films and television shows, I'd started with the how-to books; playing with scenes and characters, dialogue and structure, hoping something great might accidentally come out of me. I showed some of it Derek and Don and they saw potential, however slight, and agreed to help me turn a vague idea into a first episode of a television series. A screenplay is always a collaboration, writers need people around them to test ideas and jokes on and to challenge them to go deeper into the world they've created. After only a few months, we had a first episode of a thirty-minute television series picked up and put into development with the BBC. It was the first thing I had written, but was only possible because of the great people around me at ASP who convinced me it could be done. I'm now in the awful position of doing this for life, thanks guys."
