"Writing is one of those weird processes that you can’t really explain why you have to do it. I don’t think anyone chooses to be a writer, you kind of just are. After all, why would anyone choose to be a writer? It can be tough, lonely, you can go for months without ever getting anything done and feel like it’s all a big waste of time. It happens to every writer. What’s important is to have people in your corner, who understand the work, get what you want to say and want to make that happen; people with vision, integrity and creativity. ASP is filled with those people."
