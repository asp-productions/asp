"I had the pleasure of working with Actorshop, as a writer, a few years ago whilst developing a childrenâ€™s TV drama idea with them for CBBC. More than anything I enjoyed collaborating with the team and introducing characters and storylines rarely seen on mainstream television. Unfortunately the drama series did not get green lit but the whole experience was incredibly valuable."
